# Three Body Problem Simulation

This project simulates the **three-body problem** — the motion of three massive bodies under Newtonian gravity. The three-body problem is famous in physics and mathematics for its chaotic and non-analytical solutions.

## Features

* Numerical integration of Newton’s equations of motion.
* Visualization of the trajectories of the three bodies.
* Adjustable initial positions, velocities, and masses.

## Files

* `three_body.py` – Python script.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository and navigate to this folder:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/physics-simulations.git
   cd physics-simulations/three-body-problem
   ```
2. Install dependencies (if not already installed):

   ```bash
   pip install numpy pyglet
   ```
3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python three_body.py
   ```

**Next steps:** extend this to an *N-body simulation* and explore chaos!
